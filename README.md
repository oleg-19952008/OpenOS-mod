OpenOS mod is a modification to OS OpenComputers OpenOS
In it I make any improvements, such as the memory Manager.


P. S I know English very bad, is not an official modification. I know Lua quite a bit and very often, also know C# and unlike Lua I have more experience and I much better understand. On modification I work alone, but if someone wants to help write to sevenn1234@yandex.ru marked as DEV I will respond.
